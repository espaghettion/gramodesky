## Project timeline
I started working on this project in April of 2024, but most of the work ended up being done throughout the last week of May 2024.

## What went well
The most key features that I wanted to have in this project were all finished in time and are working the way that I want them to and I haven't encountered any major issues. 

## What didn't go well
The project was supposed to have more features, like users being able to save their favorite products and being able to browse more categories of data, like record players, record cleaning products, artist merch, etc.

Sadly the time strain did not allow me to add all of these and it was more important for me that all the core functions were working properly instead of having a huge amount of features that were broken.

You could also say that the design of the frontend didn't turn out too well because one of my goals was to make the original design better, as I'm not really a big fan of it and think it looks quite outdated. Once again, due to the time strain, I ended up making it quite basic and not that interesting, because I was quite over it at that point.

## Conclusion
Overall, I'd say the project was pretty successful and the fact that it actually works is enough for me, but it definitely could've been quite a bit better if I planned it out better and didn't crunch so hard in the last week.
